## 🏁 Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

To download the source code you just need to type this in a bash:

```console
Project-Piffa@main:~$ git clone https://github.com/Project-Piffa/EasyIPScanner
```

Now you have cloned the repository locally and you just need to start the .exe file that you can find in the /EasyIPScanner/bin/Debug/netcoreapp3.1/ folder

## 🎈 Usage <a name="usage"></a>

Type in the bash your network without the final block of numbers (example if you use 192.168.1.xxx type only 192.168.1).

Wait almost one minute for the scan finished.
